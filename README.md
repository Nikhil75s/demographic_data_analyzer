# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project involves analyzing a dataset of demographic information to answer various questions using **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data analysis. The analysis includes exploring trends related to race representation, education levels, income distribution, work hours, and occupations.

### Tasks to Accomplish

You are required to use **Pandas** to answer the following questions:

1. **Race Representation:**  
   Determine the number of people belonging to each race in the dataset. This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. *(Column: `race`)*

2. **Average Age of Men:**  
   Calculate the average age of men in the dataset.

3. **Percentage of Bachelor's Degree Holders:**  
   Compute the percentage of individuals who have earned a Bachelor's degree.

4. **Income by Education Level:**  
   - Calculate the percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate) who earn more than $50K.  
   - Calculate the percentage of people without advanced education who earn more than $50K.

5. **Minimum Working Hours:**  
   Identify the minimum number of hours a person works per week.

6. **Income of Minimum Hour Workers:**  
   Calculate the percentage of individuals working the minimum number of hours per week who earn more than $50K.

7. **Country with Highest High-Income Percentage:**  
   Identify the country with the highest percentage of individuals earning more than $50K, and compute that percentage.

8. **Top Occupation in India for High Earners:**  
   Determine the most popular occupation among individuals earning more than $50K in India.

### Development Instructions

1. **Code Implementation:**  
   Write your code in the `demographic_data_analyzer.py` file. Replace all variables set to `None` with the appropriate calculations or code. Ensure all decimals are rounded to the nearest tenth.

2. **Testing Your Code:**  
   Use the `main.py` file to test your code during development.
